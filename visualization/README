This folder is the visualization code for this 2022 bot.

It uses the Java version of turtle, which is encased entirely in Turtle.java.
Definitely nowhere near done yet and probably will be on hold until the code for swerve is done.


EDIT: WPILib provides some sort of visualization/simulation software. We will be going forward with that and not using Turtle unless the former proves impossible.
